            <br>
    
            <p>I graduated from Wingate University in 2016 with a B.S. in Marketing, and a Minor in Graphic Design. 
                Since graduating, I have done freelance Graphic Design for clients in the Charlotte area and have also worked as a marketing and design
                intern for Speed Digital, a Charlotte-based tech company. I am currently enrolled in UNCC Coding Bootcamp and I will be pursuing a job 
                as a front-end or full-stack developer following the course.</p>
            <p>
                Outside of development and design, I have a passion for soccer. I played as a defender for Wingate University and Semi-pro team, the Myrtle Beach Mutiny.
                I stay involved by doing commentary for Wingate's Soccer Teams on ESPN3, and playing in a 7v7 men's league.
